		<h3>October 2nd - 4th, Ithaca Commons</h3>

			<p>Ithaca's premier event of the Fall, Apple Harvest Festival presented by the Tompkins Trust Company, is a three day celebration of food, fun, and apples!</p>

			<p>Three fun-filled days of apples, local produce, fresh baked goods, family entertainment, games, rides, prizes and live performances on two stages. Apple Harvest Festival is a great introduction to the farms and artists in Ithaca and its surrounding farming communities</p>

			<p>First time visitors can witness a variety of wonderful local entertainment while strolling Ithaca's recently remodeled outdoor pedestrian shopping mall, The Ithaca Commons. The pedestrian mall is the epicenter of the festival and the gateway to a nostalgic journey of harvest season fun.</p>
